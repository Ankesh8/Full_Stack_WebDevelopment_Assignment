        <h2>The Earth!!!</h2>
        <p>
          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
          object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water
          world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
          water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean,
          covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust
          is land, most of which is located in the form of continental
          landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of
          Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large
          sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's
          groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's
          crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to
          produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a
          liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
          most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
