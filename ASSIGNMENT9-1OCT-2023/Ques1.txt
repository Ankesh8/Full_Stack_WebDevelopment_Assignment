01. Describe the difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one over the other?
Sol:
Grid:Grid:CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and 
columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.
Flexbox: The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and 
aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of
display devices and screen sizes.

CSS Grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage. You can build complex as well responsive design 
with this. This is why it is called ‘layout first’.
CSS grids are for 2D layouts. It works with both rows and columns.

Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks.
Flexbox works better in one dimension only (either rows OR columns).
It will be more time-saving and helpful if you use both at the same time.
