      Web design is the process of creating the visual and interactive elements
      of a website or web application. It focuses on the aesthetics, user
      interface (UI), and overall user experience (UX) of a website. Here's a
      brief overview of key aspects of web design: Visual Design: Visual design
      in web design involves creating the overall look and feel of a website.
      This includes choosing color schemes, typography (fonts), imagery, and
      graphic elements to create an appealing and cohesive design. Layout
      Design: Layout design determines how the content is organized and
      presented on a web page. Web designers decide where to place text, images,
      navigation menus, and other elements to create a visually pleasing and
      easy-to-navigate layout. Responsive Design: A significant aspect of web
      design is ensuring that websites are responsive. This means designing
      websites to adapt and display correctly on various devices and screen
      sizes, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. User
      Interface (UI) Design: UI design focuses on designing the elements that
      users interact with directly. This includes buttons, forms, menus, icons,
      and other interactive components. UI designers aim to create intuitive and
      user-friendly interfaces.
